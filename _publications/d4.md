## Abstract
We present D4, a fast concurrency analysis framework that
detects concurrency bugs (e.g., data races and deadlocks)
interactively in the programming phase. As developers add,
modify, and remove statements, the code changes are sent
to D4 to detect concurrency bugs in real time, which in
turn provides immediate feedback to the developer of the
new bugs. The cornerstone of D4 includes a novel system
design and two novel parallel differential algorithms that
embrace both change and parallelization for fundamental
static analyses of concurrent programs. Both algorithms
react to program changes by memoizing the analysis results
and only recomputing the impact of a change in parallel.
Our evaluation on an extensive collection of large real-world
applications shows that D4 efficiently pinpoints concurrency
bugs within 100ms on average after a code change, several
orders of magnitude faster than both the exhaustive analysis
and the state-of-the-art incremental techniques.
