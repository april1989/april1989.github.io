I am a first year Ph.D. student at [Department of Computer Science](https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/index.html), Texas A&M University. I work with [Dr. Jeff Huang](https://parasol.tamu.edu/~jeff/) on Program Analysis and Software Engineering. My research interests are incremental analysis, pointer analysis, concurrent system, program testing and debugging about concurrency bugs. Before that, I got my master's degree from Department of [Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering](https://www.mae.cornell.edu/mae) at Cornell University, and my bachelor's degree from [Department of Mechanical Engineering](http://me-english.bit.edu.cn/) at Beijing Institute of Technology.
